# Training Robot for FRC Programming Teams
This code is designed to be used as a teaching tool for programming teams involved in the <i>First Robotics Competition</i>.  FRCRobot1 is the introductory level code and should be installed first to begin the teaching process. This introductory level code creates the basic structure of the robot that will be used throughout the course. Each level will build on this basic structure and add more functionality. 

The code is installed on a training robot.  The Bill-of-Materials and construction of this robot is described below.

# <a name="ide"></a>Development Environment Setup
The code must be run on an ESP32 NodeMCU development board, which is an embedded Arduino based microcontroller.  For the development environment (IDE) we'll be using VSCode.  This is the IDE commonly used by <i>First Robotics</i> teams.  In order to install code onto the ESP32 microcontoller you have to install the PlatformIO plugin for VSCode. The PlatformIO plugin install is explained in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5edPOlQQKmo)

The FRCRobot1 code can be cloned from Github. Following these instructions:

# <a name="bom"></a>Hardware Bill-of-Materials
The links in this BOM will show multiple pieces for most products.  It's assumed that teams will want to build more than one robot and this will reduce the cost per unit. Single pieces are available but at a higher cost per item.  Most items come with the screws and wires. Some additional hardware items maybe required.
